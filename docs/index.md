## A Study on Machine vs. Human Perception of Pop Song Structure

### feat. Karen Bao, Stacey Chao, Vivian Chen <br/>


## Intro 

Structure is one of the key characteristics that makes a song catchy by providing a balance between repetition and variation, despite the fact that we aren't actively aware of structure when we're listening to the song. Most songs are made up of a few different sections: Intro, Verse, Chorus, Bridge (or Transition), and Outro. In this project, we focus on pop songs and whether machines can detect song structure better than humans can, especially when a song's structure is vague to human ears.


## Verse

We created our program by building off of two sources of code: Oriol Nieto's song segmenter (https://github.com/urinieto/msaf) and Vivek Jayaram's chorus detector (https://github.com/vivjay30/pychorus). 

## Chorus


## Verse
User testing was done on 9 subjects, all of whom are college students who listen to pop songs regularly. 

## Outro
